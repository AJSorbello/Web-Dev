1. Why Django is Popular Among Web Developers
Django is popular among web developers because it is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It comes with many built-in features that simplify tasks such as database management, user authentication, and URL routing, allowing developers to focus on writing the application instead of reinventing the wheel.
Additionally, Django is known for its "batteries-included" philosophy, meaning it includes everything developers need to build web applications quickly, while also being highly scalable and secure.
2. Large Companies Using Django
After some research, here are five large companies that use Django:

Instagram: Social media platform where users can share photos and videos. Django is used to manage the large-scale and dynamic content on the platform, including the handling of massive user traffic.
Spotify: Music streaming service offering on-demand access to millions of songs and podcasts. Spotify uses Django to manage its web application and backend infrastructure, including the recommendation engine and user interactions.
Pinterest: Visual discovery engine that allows users to find and save ideas through images and videos. Pinterest uses Django to handle its backend and manage the millions of user-generated content items.
Mozilla: Developer of the Firefox web browser and other internet-related products. Mozilla uses Django for a variety of their web applications, including the Firefox Add-ons website.
Disqus: Comment hosting service for websites and blogs. Django powers Disqusâ€™s backend, enabling the platform to manage millions of comments and users effectively.
3. Scenarios for Using Django
Developing a Web Application with Multiple Users:

Use Django: Yes, because Django provides robust support for user authentication and authorization out-of-the-box, making it easy to manage multiple users with different permissions and roles.
Fast Deployment and Ability to Make Changes as You Proceed:

Use Django: Yes, Django is well-suited for fast deployment and iterative development due to its built-in admin interface, ORM, and modular design, which allow developers to make and test changes quickly.
Building a Very Basic Application Without Database Access or File Operations:

Use Django: No, Django might be overkill for a basic application without database access or file operations. A simpler framework like Flask or a micro-framework could be more appropriate for such a project.
Building an Application from Scratch with a Lot of Control:

Use Django: No, if you require fine-grained control over every aspect of the application, Django might not be the best choice due to its "batteries-included" philosophy. A micro-framework like Flask would offer more flexibility and control.
Starting a Big Project and Needing Additional Support:

Use Django: Yes, because Django has a large, active community and extensive documentation, making it easier to find support and resources when working on a big project.
